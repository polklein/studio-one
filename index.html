  <h2>A Guide to Djing Studio One Records at House Parties</h2>
  <p>This guide is a community project, aiming to help people navigate the mind-numbing record pressing maze of the legendary Studio One label. It is by no means intended to be a definitive guide (nothing is definitive with Studio One due to terrible quality control). It is my hope that this guide will serve as a resource for those on a similar journey to figure out the best quality pressings of critical Studio One tracks.
</p>
<p> Collecting Jamaican music isn't glamorous. I've been flashed on in West Oakland while buying records from an old Jamaican couple. I've spent days wearing a cheap gas mask while digging through rat-shit-infested attics and basements. I have traversed the five boroughs in New York City looking for old Studio One 45s and (arguably) discovering more of my own roots than anything else. </p>
<p> This project has been a long time coming for me - my father was from the North Bronx/White Plains area and was a lifelong student of Jamaican music. From him I inherited my obsessive nature about record collecting, my love for Jamaican music, and my exhaustive researching habits.</p>
<!--<p>
  It is also important to mention that this project has not been a solo effort - I've gotten plenty of help along the way from some serious Jamaican music authorities. Special mention is due to Dub Store and Drum and Bass Records, who supply an incredible amount of public data on the quality of various Studio One pressings, and to Rob Chapman, whose guides were indispensable to me in a pre-Discogs world. A sincere thank you is also due to my friends and family who have played various roles in the highlights of my record digging career and execution of musical projects throughout the years.

    In truth, no man is an island, and I can only hope to be helpful to others who love Studio One. Please feel free to write to me with any questions or input, it is all a work in progress.
